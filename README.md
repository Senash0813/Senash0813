## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Senash, I'm a final year Data Science undergraduate interested in all things that are AI. I have a solid foundation in AI/ML concepts and experience building end-to-end ML workflows.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on research aimed at reducing hallucinations and inaccuracies in RAG pipelines by refining each step of the pipeline leading up to the final response.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about AI workflow automation (n8n, zapier etc.)

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm an Excellent communicator! and loves teamwork.
